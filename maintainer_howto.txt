This file contains a short walk-through of how what is needed to release a new version in CRAN.

For a in-depth documentation see:

# Linux packages:
To build pdf manual correctly:
sudo apt install pandoc texinfo

# R packages (not an exhaustive list):
install.packages(c('devtools','hunspell','roxygen2'))
library(devtools)


## To update things, run (at the root folder of the package):
devtools::document()
devtools::build()


## To check that everything is as it is supposed to

devtools::document()
# Note: For Roxygen2 the keywords need to be separated by a single
# space from #' for them to work. In case there are multiple spaces or 
# tabs Roxygen does to identify the keywords correctly and they do not
# get added to NAMESPACE.

devtools::spell_check()

# To build the package
devtools::build()
devtools::build_win() #to check on a windows machine

## To run CRAN checks
devtools::check()
devtools::check(manual = T)

## Check reverse dependencies
devtools::revdep_check()
d <-readRDS('./revdep/checks.rds')


## To upload to CRAN for release
devtools::release()

# Upon devtools::release() the system will ask you:
# 1. Were Git checks successful?
#    If the package is also a git repo make sure git status is clean.
# 2. Is documentation free of spelling errors?
#    Use devtools::spell_check() to check.
# 3. Was R CMD check successful?
#    Use devtools::check(manual = T) to test.
# 4. Were devtool's checks successful? (todo: How to invoke this?)
#   These are:
#   Checking version number has three components... OK
#   Checking dependencies don't rely on dev versions... OK
#   Checking vignette titles are not placeholders... OK
#   Checking NEWS.md is not ignored... OK
#   Checking NEWS.Rd does not exist... OK
#   Checking DESCRIPTION doesn't have Remotes field... OK
# 5. Have you fixed all existing problems at 
#    https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_cocoreg.html?
#   Do not know how this gets created...
# 6.Have you checked on win-builder (with devtools::build_win())?
# 7. Have you updated your NEWS file?
# 8. Is DESCRIPTION up-to-date?
# 9. Are the CRAN submission comments correct?
# 10. Is your email address xxxx?
#
# Make sure at least tasks 1-10 have been completed before trying to release.

# It might be useful to add the following files to .Rbuildignore so that
# they are not checked nor added to the package:
# devtools::use_build_ignore("cran-comments.md")
# devtools::use_build_ignore("README.Rmd")
# devtools::use_build_ignore("README.html")
# devtools::use_build_ignore("README.pdf")
# devtools::use_build_ignore("revdep")

## To install the packeage from a local copy (defaults to working dir)
devtools::install()
